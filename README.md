# RealTime-FaceDetection  (2021.11.10)
Real-Time Face Detection using Python and OpenCV This repository contains a simple and effective project for real-time face detection using Python and OpenCV. The program leverages the Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces in a live webcam feed and draws a green bounding box around detected faces.
# Features
Real-Time Detection: Captures live video feed from the webcam and processes it frame by frame.
Face Detection: Uses a pre-trained Haar Cascade XML model to identify frontal faces.
Interactive Visualization: Displays a bounding box around detected faces on the video feed.
# How It Works
The webcam feed is captured using OpenCV.
The captured frames are converted to grayscale for better detection accuracy.
Haar Cascade Classifier scans the image for patterns matching a face.
If a face is detected, a green rectangle is drawn around it.
